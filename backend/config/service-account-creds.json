Also I typed in my email on the contact form and used a netlify page and then I tried the form but ALL websites generated need their contact forms improved so they actually tell the user if the image has been sent etc it currently just resets the page to home when you click send message so that needs improving and of course no email was received on the email I typed in on the contact form when I attempted to send a message on the generated site.
